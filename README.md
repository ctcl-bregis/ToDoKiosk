# ToDoKiosk

ToDoKiosk is a Django web application that was made within three hours on October 31, 2023. The application was made in response to the lack of a web-based CalDAV tasks client. The application is made for showing tasks on a monitor on the side of a bookshelf near my desk to display current tasks on a CalDAV server.
